# Mentum Postman Collections

Welcome to the Mentum Postman Collections Quickstart Guide! This is a quick and easy way to get started with the Mentum API with no additional code.

## Getting started

1. Checkout this repository to get access to our Postman Collection and Environment variables.
2. In Postman, use File â†’ Import to import the Postman Collection and Environment.

## Quickstart

Once you have completed the steps in the Getting started section above, you are ready to make API requests using Postman! The following steps are a quick walkthrough to making an API request. In this example, we will use the special capabilities of the Sandbox test environment to bypass the client-side Link UI and make all of our requests via the backend.

1. Make sure the "Collection" pane is selected, then expand the "Mentum API" folder on the left and navigate to Mentum API to see the available Mentum API endpoints. Click the endpoint listed under the Collection to send an API request, modify the request data, to see the request response, and more
2. In the pane on the right, which has the options "Params", "Authorization", "Headers" etc. click on the "Body" tab.
3. Click the blue "Send" button on the right.
4. The response body should appear in Postman.
5. Select any product endpoint of your choice. If you are not sure which one to use, a good simple example is "Account Transactions". Expand the Monitoring folder and click on the endpoint you would like to use ("Account Transactions", if you are using balance).
6. Click on the "Body" tab. Complete any other required fields (for Balance, there are none) and click "Send".
7. You will receive a response containing your requested data!
